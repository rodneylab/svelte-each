Demo code: colour palette app which helps explain Svelte each blocks as well as const directives, destructuring within each blocks and style directives. The code accompanies the <a aria-label="Open Rodney Lab video post on Svelte Each blocks" href="https://rodneylab.com/using-svelte-each-blocks/">video post on using each blocks in Svelte</a>. If you have any questions, please drop a comment at the bottom of that page.

## Building and previewing the site

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

cd svelte-each
pnpm install # or npm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Building
